WordPress Link Checker
======================
Simple script that lets you know about the status of certain URLs occuring in your WordPress blog's posts.

## Usage
Download the `check.php` file and put it into the directory of your WordPress installation. Open the script in your web browser.
It should detect your database configuration automagically, if not, then you will be prompted for missing data.

## AJAX version
You may now download the development version. To do so, switch to the `devel` branch and pull/download the script again. In the new version, the statistics
are loaded via AJAX, so you won't wait for the index so long anymore.
